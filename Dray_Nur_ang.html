                    <h2>Description</h2>
                        <p>
                            Dray Nur and Dray Sap waterfalls, located in Dak Lak province, in the heart of Vietnam, are two of the country's most impressive natural wonders. Nestled within the heart of the rainforest, these waterfalls offer visitors an immersive experience in the raw beauty of this wilderness. <br>
                            <br> Dray Nur, also nicknamed "the queen of waterfalls" due to its size, is indeed the larger of the two.
                            This waterfall is situated on the Krong Kno River and spans approximately 250 meters in width, with a main drop of about 30 meters in height.
                            It is also surrounded by lush vegetation, steep cliffs, and natural pools, creating a breathtakingly beautiful landscape.<br>

                            <br>Dray Sap, or "the little sister," is the neighboring waterfall to Dray Nur.
                            Although smaller in size, it doesn't lack charm.
                            Dray Sap is more intimate and provides a peaceful atmosphere for visitors looking to relax and rejuvenate.
                            You can swim in the natural pools formed by the waterfalls and enjoy the tranquility of the surrounding forest. <br>

                    The ongoing erosion of limestone rocks has created the spectacular waterfalls we can see today. <br>
                    <br>During the 19th and 20th centuries, Vietnam experienced major upheavals, including under French colonial occupation and during the Vietnam War.

                <h2>The Culinary Art of the Region</h2>
                    <p>
                    The Dak Lak region, where Dray Nur and Dray Sap waterfalls are located, is renowned for its cuisine, which is influenced by the minority ethnic cultures and abundant natural resources of the area. One of the most beloved culinary specialties in this area is "Banh Xeo," a delicious Vietnamese "pancake." <br>
                    <br>Banh Xeo is prepared by mixing rice flour, coconut water, turmeric, and salt to create a thin batter. The filling varies, but it typically includes shrimp, pork, bean sprouts, fresh herbs like cilantro and mint, as well as bamboo shoots and other vegetables. <br>

                    <br>Banh Xeo is usually served with lettuce or rice paper, fresh herbs, and vegetables, which serve as a wrap for the "pancake."
                    It is then dipped in a sauce made from fish sauce, lime, chili, and garlic, which adds a spicy and salty flavor to the dish. <br>

                    <br>Each region has its own variation of this "pancake." <br>
