                <h2>History of the Place</h2>
                    <p>
                    Archaeological evidence suggests that the Halong Bay area was inhabited thousands of years ago. Archaeological discoveries have revealed traces of prehistoric communities living on the bay's islands. <br>
                    <br> Halong Bay has witnessed battles and conflicts throughout its history. The Le Dynasty, which ruled Vietnam from the 15th to the 18th century, fortified the region to defend the country against foreign invaders. <br>

                    <br> This continued until the Vietnam War, during which Halong Bay was the scene of intense fighting, especially on the neighboring islands. Many areas of the bay were affected by the conflicts. <br>

                <h2>Regional Culinary Art</h2>
                    <p>
                    Halong Bay is a region in Vietnam renowned for its delicious and diverse cuisine, and an indispensable culinary specialty in this area is "Hoa Sua." This small mangrove apple is a unique delicacy that reflects the richness of the region's nature. <br>
                    <br> Hoa Sua is a rare fruit mainly found in the coastal regions of northern Vietnam, including around Halong Bay. It grows on trees known as Rhizophora apiculata, which are characteristic of mangrove areas. <br>

                    <br> Hoa Sua has a unique flavor, blending sweetness and tartness. The texture is both firm and juicy, with a thin skin and white flesh. <br>

                    <br> Locals in the region use Hoa Sua in various local culinary preparations. It can be enjoyed as a seafood fruit on its own, but it is also used to flavor dishes such as seafood salads, fish stews, and dipping sauces. <br>
