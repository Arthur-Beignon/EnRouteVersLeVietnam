                <h2>Economic Information</h2>
                <p>
                    The Vietnamese economy is constantly expanding and has grown remarkably in recent decades.<br/>
                    
                    <br/>Vietnam has managed to balance its socialist heritage with market-oriented economic reforms, which has led to a booming economy. The manufacturing industry, particularly the production of clothing, electronics and agricultural products, plays an essential role in the country’s economy. <br/>
                    <br/>In addition, Vietnam has become a key player in the global supply chain, attracting many international companies through an affordable and skilled workforce.<br/>
                    
                    <br/>Tourism is constantly growing, contributing significantly to the Vietnamese economy.<br/>
