                    <p>
                        The Golden Bridge, also known as "Cau Vang," is one of Vietnam's most iconic attractions and a remarkable architectural feat. 
                        The name "Golden Bridge" is inspired by the bridge's brilliant golden color. <br>

                        The entire bridge is adorned with architecture inspired by Buddhist mythology, featuring dragons and traditional Vietnamese motifs.<br>

                        <br>The bridge offers spectacular panoramic views of the Han River and its surroundings, making it an ideal spot for photography and admiring the region's natural beauty.<br>

                        <br>The Golden Bridge is particularly enchanting at night when its golden lights illuminate, creating a spectacle of magical colors and reflections. 
                        It's one of Danang's most beloved nighttime attractions.<br>

                <p>
                    The Golden Bridge in Danang has a relatively short history.

                    <br>The bridge was designed to evoke the image of a golden strip stretched by giant hands.

                    Dragons are traditionally associated with prosperity, power, and protection.   <br>

                    <br>Since its completion, the Golden Bridge has become a major tourist attraction in Danang. 
                    Its unique design and location above the Han River have made it a must-visit destination for tourists.<br>

                    The city has become increasingly popular among domestic and international travelers, largely thanks to this iconic attraction. <br>
